				One day, disturbing absolutely no one, my favorite Chess Pieces (the two Kings and a Pawn) were minding their own business along a path on a very large chessboard. Suddenly out of nowhere, swinging on a parabolic arc came a banana. It crashed into my Pawn, sending bits and pieces flying everywhere.
