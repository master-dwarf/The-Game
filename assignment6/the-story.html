				One day, disturbing absolutely no one, my favorite (interesting object A) was moving along a path in (location of scene).
				Suddenly out of nowhere, swinging on a (elliptical, circular, parabolic) arc came a (interesting object B). It crashed into
				my (interesting object A again), sending bits and pieces flying everywhere.
