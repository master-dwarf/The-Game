Commit style should follow these conventions:
    \<type\>[optional scope]: \<description\>

    Where type is:
        fix - bug fix
        feat - new feature
        chore - clean up code (delete unnecessary comments and unnecessary code) or add clarifying comments
        docs - update documentation
        style - changes that neither fix nor add feature
        refactor - changes that 
        perf - performance enhancement

    And scope is the affected feature (e.g. arena, villian, hero, thingSeeking).
